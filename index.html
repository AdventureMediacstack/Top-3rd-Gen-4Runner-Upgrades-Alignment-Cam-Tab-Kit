                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Why the Alignment Cam &amp; Cam Tab Upgrade Kit Matters</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>The stock alignment cams on your 3rd Gen 4Runner,  and similar Toyota platforms,  are notoriously weak. A few hard hits off-road or even years of driving on bumpy terrain can knock them loose, shear them off, or throw your alignment out of spec. That can lead to uneven tire wear, poor handling, and costly suspension damage.</span></p>
